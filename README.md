# CoffeShop_Report
I gained this dataset in RevoU Data Analytics Course. They need to be able to monitor their sales dally, to plan their production, inventory, and marketing strategies. 

## Project Objectives 
1. What are the five most sold products in terms of quantity?
2. Which day of the week is the busiest for the coffee shop in terms of transaction count?
3. Which hour of the day has the highest sales?
4. What are the top five product categories based on sales for each of the transaction months?

## I contributed in data cleaning and data visualisation to find the answer using Tableau.
